  <h1>cfkd - Custom Generator Implementation</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In cfkd, you have the flexibility to implement custom generators for various purposes. Custom generators allow you to create specialized iterable objects that can be used in loops or other iterable operations.</p>

  <h2>Implementing a Custom Generator</h2>
  <p>To implement a custom generator in cfkd, follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Create a Python class and define it as an iterator by implementing the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.</li>
    <li>In the `__iter__` method, return the instance of the class itself to make it iterable.</li>
    <li>In the `__next__` method, define the logic for generating and returning the next value in the iteration. Raise the `StopIteration` exception when there are no more values to generate.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Here's an example implementation of a custom generator that generates a sequence of even numbers:</p>

  <pre><code>class EvenNumberGenerator:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.current = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.limit:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            even_number = self.current
            self.current += 2
            return even_number

# Usage example
even_numbers = EvenNumberGenerator(10)
for number in even_numbers:
    print(number)</code></pre>

  <p>In the above example, the `EvenNumberGenerator` class generates even numbers up to a given limit. The generator is used in a loop to print each even number until the limit is reached.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Implementing custom generators in cfkd provides a powerful way to create iterable objects tailored to your specific needs. With custom generators, you can efficiently generate and process data in a flexible and controlled manner.</p>

  <p>For more information and advanced usage of custom generators, refer to the official cfkd documentation.</p>
